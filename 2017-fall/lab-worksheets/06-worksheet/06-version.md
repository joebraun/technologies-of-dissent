   request to our Github repository.

## Extra Challenge

9. Explain the difference between a fork and a clone.

10. Find a small spelling error on the *Programming Historian* and submit a
    pull request to the owners. (Check with me for this option, if you are not
sure).

## Hints

Steps for your first pull request (PR):

- Fork the project (via the GitHub interface online). This copies the *whole
  repository* from my account on the GitHub servers to your account.

- Clone the project (via the command line or GUI). This copies the repository
  from your remote GitHub account to your local machine.

- Make your changes. In this case you are simply adding a file to the
  repository (give it a unique file name).

- Push your changes to GitHub. This copies your local changes to the remote.

- Using the GitHub interface file a pull request. This will notify me to pull
  your changes into my repository (from the first step).
